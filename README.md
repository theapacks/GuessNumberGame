# GuessNumberGame
A game from the course "React Native - The Practical Guide" by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller

You provide a number and the app tries to guess the number as you provide hints by telling it to go 
higher or lower from the current guess.

To run:
cd <application_directory>
npm install
npm start / npm run android / npm run ios
